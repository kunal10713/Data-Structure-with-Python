# Sliding Window Concept in Data Structures
The sliding window is a commonly used technique in solving array or string problems where you're required to look at subarrays or substrings. It is efficient when you need to analyze a subset of elements at a time, making it more optimal than using nested loops to find such subsets.

# When to Apply Sliding Window
You should apply the sliding window technique when:

- You're dealing with a contiguous subarray or substring.
- You need to solve problems related to finding:
    - Maximum, minimum, or sum of a subarray.
    - Longest or shortest subarray with certain properties.
    - Subarrays with fixed or variable lengths that satisfy a condition.

For example:
    - Finding the longest substring without repeating characters.
    - Finding the maximum sum of any subarray of a fixed size.
    - Finding the shortest subarray with a sum greater than a certain value.


## Complexity
- Time Complexity: Sliding window problems are often solved in O(n) time complexity, since you typically move two pointers (start and end) from left to right across the input without reprocessing elements unnecessarily.

- Space Complexity: Generally, space complexity remains O(1), since you don't use additional structures (unless the problem requires auxiliary space).
