## Selection Sort Explained
Selection Sort is a simple, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the sorting order) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moves it to the beginning of the list, thus expanding the sorted portion one element at a time.


### Time Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of selection sort depends on the number of comparisons made during the sorting process.

### Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case Scenarios
- Best Case: O(n²)
    - The best case is no different from the worst case because selection sort always performs the same number of comparisons. Even if the array is already sorted, it still compares every element.

- Worst Case: O(n²)
    - In the worst case, selection sort still goes through the same number of comparisons and swaps, regardless of how the elements are arranged.

    - Regardless of the initial order of the elements, the algorithm always performs the same number of comparisons, because it goes through all the remaining unsorted elements to find the minimum for each step.

### Space Complexity
- Space Complexity: O(1)

Selection sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require additional memory for another array or list. It only uses a constant amount of extra space for index variables.

### Use Cases of Selection Sort
- Selection sort is not the most efficient algorithm for large datasets, but it has a few specific use cases where it might be considered:

    - Small Datasets: Selection sort is useful for sorting small arrays or lists where the overhead of more complex algorithms (like merge sort or quicksort) is not justified.

    - Memory-Constrained Environments: Because it has a space complexity of O(1), selection sort can be used in scenarios where memory usage needs to be minimized
