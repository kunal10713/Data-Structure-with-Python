# Variable-Size Sliding Window
- In a variable-size sliding window, the window size changes dynamically during the traversal of the array based on certain conditions. The window can either grow or shrink depending on the problem's constraints.

## Characteristics:
- The window can expand or shrink as necessary, usually based on some condition being met (e.g., the sum of elements exceeding a threshold).
- The size of the window is not fixed and is determined dynamically.
- This is commonly used in problems where you're looking for subarrays or sublists that meet a specific condition (e.g., smallest subarray with a sum greater than a given value, or finding subarrays with a certain number of distinct characters).
