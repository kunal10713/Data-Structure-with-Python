# Explanation of the pivot_element Code

This code is designed to find the index of the pivot element in a rotated sorted array using binary search. In a rotated sorted array, the pivot is the point where the original sorted order is disrupted due to rotation. For example, in the array `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, the pivot element is `0` at index `4`. This algorithm helps identify the pivot efficiently in `O(log n)` time complexity.



### Explanation of the else Logic
Here's the relevant part of the code:

```python
# If mid element is greater than or equal to the first element,
# the pivot is in the right half, so move start to mid + 1
if arr[mid] >= arr[0]:
    start = mid + 1
# Otherwise, the pivot is in the left half, so move end to mid
else:
    end = mid
```
#### What the else Block Does
1. ondition: The else block executes when arr[mid] < arr[0].
- This means the mid element is less than the first element of the array (arr[0]).
- This condition indicates that the pivot element lies in the left half of the current search space.
2. Action: Set end = mid.
- This moves the end pointer to mid.
- By doing this, we include mid in the new search range, narrowing down the search to the left half of the array.

#### Why Not Use end = mid - 1?
- Using end = mid instead of end = mid - 1 ensures that we do not miss out on the mid index itself.
- When the array is rotated, the pivot element (smallest element) can lie anywhere in the left half once we detect that arr[mid] is less than arr[0].
- Hence, moving end to mid ensures we include the current mid in the search range.
- The end pointer is only moved when we know for sure that all elements to its right (including mid) are in the potential range where the pivot might lie.

### Time Complexity: O(log n)
- The binary search technique reduces the search space by half in each step, making it highly efficient for large arrays.

### Space Complexity: O(1)
- Only a few variables are used (start, end, mid), making the space usage constant.
